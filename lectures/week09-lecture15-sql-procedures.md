# SQL Procedures

## Automating Database Queries

Databases can automate operations and enforce business logic using:

- Procedures - SQL code you can call when needed (like functions)
- Triggers - SQL code that runs automatically after certain events (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

## Procedures

-a named block of SQL code saved in the database that can be called whenever needed

Benefits:

- Reusablility - can execute the same logic multiple times with 1 command
- Maintainability - logic stays in one place, easy to update or fix
- Security - execute procedures without direct access to tables
- Performance - stored and compiled in database for faster execution
- Automation - great for complex operations
